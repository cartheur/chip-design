## OrCad (Cadence) tutorials

This area contains the tutorial files for the capture (design) and the pcb (manufacture) operations. The accompanying videos for the projects described here are found at:

* Capture
-- https://resources.orcad.com/orcad-capture-tutorials
* PCB Editor
-- https://resources.orcad.com/orcad-pcb-editor-tutorials

The first thing to do is load the capture and pcb symbol libraries that came with the tutorials.

### Capture

* Tutorial video number two

1. Create a new library using the 17.4 version of OrCad. : File|New Library
2. Right-click and save as the project name

* Copy the existing Cadence libraries: File|Open|Library

1. Figure out why a simple part footprint, like a C0201 is _not_ part of the basic library that comes with the software?
