## CHIP-v1.0

This is the base version of the new design where we want to begin. It is desired that this platform be reproduced with updated components while keeping to the power-performance and operational characteristics of this version. Although this version has data from the Allwinner R8, other chipsets are open for consideration, there is no restriction on the new kinds of components, as long as the functionality is maintained and performance improved. Other datasheets are provided as to the components on this 1.0 version.

For potential design companies who wish to work with us: Take the files in this repository (CHIP[v1_0]) and, perform the following analysis:

1. Focus on improvements in the SoC components - CPU, memory, bus, etc., 
2. Suggest design choices subsequent to the improvements,
3. Tally a cost profile for the changes and prototype manufacture,
4. Propose further improvements in accessories to have a complete package.

Specific details

* The target OS for the new design is <a href="https://debian.org">Debian 11</a> with Linux kernel <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.14.1.tar.xz">5.14.1</a>.
* For the time-being, only focus on the board itself and not the accessories such as cabling and DIPs.

## Source Files
